									<h3><a href="https://github.com/vtillis/Big-Data-Machine-Learning">Big Data & Machine Learning Presentation</h3></a>
									<p>This master's presentation introduces the concepts of big data and machine learning to provide an overview of these rapidly evolving technologies. 
It covers the challenges of dealing with massive amounts of data, and how big data tools and technologies can be used to store, process and analyze this data.
 The presentation also explores different machine learning algorithms and techniques, including supervised and unsupervised learning, deep learning, and neural networks.
 The goal of the presentation is to provide a foundational understanding of big data and machine learning, including their applications and potential for future developments. 
 The presentation would likely include case studies and examples to illustrate the concepts discussed, and would be tailored to a non-technical audience.</p>

									<h3><a href="https://github.com/vtillis/Customer-Journey-Map---Template">Customer Journey Map Template</h3></a>
									<p>A customer journey map is a visual representation of the different stages a customer goes through when interacting with a business, 
										from the initial awareness stage to post-purchase support. It outlines the touchpoints that a customer has with a business,
										including online interactions, in-store experiences, customer service interactions, and more.
										The purpose of a customer journey map is to help businesses understand their customers better by identifying pain points, 
										areas of opportunity, and moments of truth where a customer's experience can be positively or negatively impacted. By mapping out the customer
										journey, businesses can gain insights into how they can improve their customer experience, increase customer satisfaction, and drive customer loyalty.</p>
